Scripts to download wrf model data like GFS and WPS_GEOGRAPHY (WPS_GEOG)

In order to run the scripts (via linux os) ensure that they are executables by using the command 
  chmod +x gfs_data_download.sh 
  chmod +x wps_geog_lowresolution.sh
  chmod +x wps_geog_highres.sh

To run the script simply type the following command in your terminal
  ./gfs_data_download.sh 
  ,/wps_geog_lowresolution.sh
  ./wps_geog_highres.sh

Note that you only need to run WPS_GEOG scripts once but you will need run the GFS scripts whenever you need to use the most rescent GFS data
